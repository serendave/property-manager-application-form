# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# How to start the project

1. Run `npm ci` (or ` pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`) to install the necessary dependencies
2. After that, run `npm run dev` to run the application
3. Go to http://localhost:5173 and you should be able to view the application

## Additional

1. You can also run the storybook to check the stories created for components, for that run: `npm run storybook`
   and go to the http://localhost:6006
2. You can also view the storybook interaction tests created for each component, under the tab: "Interaction"
